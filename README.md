# What makes a "good" movie?


## Description 


To help out our future filmmakers and fellow movie-goers, we plan to provide an interactive web app that answers the question: what defines a movie's success? More specifically, we will look at common metrics such as revenue, budget, audience ratings, and Oscar Award nominations by year to get a sense of what movies and movie types deserve the title of "good".
